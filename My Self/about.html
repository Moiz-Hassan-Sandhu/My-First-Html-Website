            <li><b><header>VideoGames: </header></b></li>
            I have been playing video games since I was 5 years old, I have played Age of Empire, Taken, GTA and many more but the game I was most inspired by<br>
            is Call of Duty Black Ops 3, in this game,there was a character who can hack any digital device by hiselectro-mechanical arm. Through this feature of<br>
            the game I found my interest in hacking and cyber security. I became more curious about the process of making of that game so I choose science in my <br>
            metric and intermediate also.<b> I remember that I used to tell my mother: "Today, others are playing games but I am going to develop one my-self ".</b><br><br>
